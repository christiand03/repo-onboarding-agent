# Project Documentation: repo-onboarding-agent

## 1. Project Overview
- **Description:** An autonomous agent designed for analyzing Git repositories. It orchestrates a multi-step analysis pipeline including cloning, parsing file structures, performing Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis, generating call graphs, and using an LLM helper to describe code components.
- **Key Features:** 
  - Git Repository Cloning and File Traversal
  - Python AST Analysis and Call Graph Generation
  - LLM-assisted Code Description
  - Streamlit Frontend for interaction
- **Tech Stack:** 
  - Python
  - GitPython (for repository operations)
  - `ast` and `networkx` (for code analysis and graph generation)
  - Streamlit (for the user interface)
- **Status:** [Information not found]
