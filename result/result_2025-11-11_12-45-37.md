[!!] **WARNING: ANALYSIS INCOMPLETE**
This documentation may be incomplete due to errors encountered during repository analysis or because certain information could not be located. Specifically, the detailed function/class analysis (signatures, parameters, returns, and LLM-generated descriptions) is missing. Sections with missing data are marked accordingly.

# Project Documentation: repo-onboarding-agent

## 1. Project Overview
- **Description:** A Python project designed as a repository onboarding agent. Its core function involves using tools for Git repository cloning, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis, call graph generation, and leveraging an LLM for structured code description and documentation generation.
- **Key Features:** 
  - Git Repository Cloning and File Traversal.
  - Comprehensive Code Analysis (AST and Call Graph generation).
  - Component for LLM-based function/class documentation generation.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, GitPython (for repo handling), `ast` (for code analysis), `networkx` or similar (for call graphs), and likely a framework like LangChain/Pydantic for LLM integration (inferred from `HelperLLM.py`).
