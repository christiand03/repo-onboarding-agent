## 4. Use Cases & Commands
The repository primarily defines the Flask framework and contains examples demonstrating common use cases like running asynchronous background tasks (Celery example) and implementing a basic blog application (Tutorial example).

**Primary CLI Commands (Defined in `src/flask/cli.py`):**

| Command | Description (Derived from cli.py docstrings) |
| :--- | :--- |
| `flask run` | Run a local development server. Not recommended for production. |
| `flask shell` | Run an interactive Python shell in the application context for executing small management snippets. |
| `flask routes` | Show all registered routes with endpoints and methods. |
| `flask init-db` | *From tutorial example:* Clear existing data and create new tables. |

value for a given file path if it wasn't passed.

the configuration of :data:`~flask.current_app`. This defaults
to ``None``, which tells the browser to use conditional requests
instead of a timed cache, which is usually preferable.*
