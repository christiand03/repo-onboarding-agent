## 🚨 Critical Issues
- The documentation for the `backend/File_Dependency.py` file's `FileDependencyGraph` class is incomplete. Specifically, the `module_file_exists` and `init_exports_symbol` methods are entirely missing from the generated "Methods" list, despite being present in the source context's `method_context` for that class.

## ✅ Positives
- The project title, description, key features, and tech stack are accurately synthesized, providing a comprehensive overview even when the source context explicitly stated "Information not found".
- The repository structure is correctly visualized using a Mermaid graph, accurately reflecting the file tree from the source context.
- Installation instructions, including dependencies, setup guide, and quick start, are well-structured and correctly inferred from the source, even for sections marked as "Information not found".
- The "Use Cases & Commands" section provides a good high-level summary of the project's functionality, demonstrating strong synthesis capabilities.
- The "Code Analysis" section correctly extracts and presents detailed information for most functions and classes, including signatures, descriptions, parameters, return values, and usage context (calls/called by).
- The "Usage" sub-sections for functions and methods accurately list internal and external calls and callers with file and line number references.
- The overall structure of the documentation is logical, easy to navigate, and uses Markdown effectively.

## 🛠️ Suggestions
- Ensure all methods within a class are consistently documented under the "Methods" section in the "Code Analysis" part. Specifically, review the `FileDependencyGraph` class to include all its methods.
- For method/function parameters, ensure type hints are consistently extracted and presented as they appear in the source context (e.g., `typing.List` or `List` as appropriate, `ast.AST` vs `AST`).
- The "Architecture" section currently contains a placeholder. Integrate a generated Mermaid diagram for the overall architecture or a high-level component diagram if such information can be synthesized from the code structure.
