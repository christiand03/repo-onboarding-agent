The function generates a unique identifier for the exchange and constructs a dictionary representing the exchange record. It then attempts to insert this record into the database using `dbexchanges.insert_one`. If successful, the function returns the new identifier; otherwise, it catches any exceptions, prints an error message, and returns `None`. The function relies on the `uuid` module for generating unique identifiers and the `datetime` module for timestamping the record creation.
